1. What is Armitage?
   -----------------
Armitage is a graphical cyber attack management tool for Metasploit that 
visualizes your targets, recommends exploits, and exposes the advanced 
capabilities of the framework.

Advanced users will find Armitage valuable for managing remote Metasploit 
instances and collaboration. Armitage's red team collaboration features allow 
your team to use the same sessions, share data, and communicate through one 
Metasploit instance.

Armitage aims to make Metasploit usable for security practitioners who 
understand hacking but don't use Metasploit every day. If you want to learn 
Metasploit and grow into the advanced features, Armitage can help you.
