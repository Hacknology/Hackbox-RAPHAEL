How to use
----------
You can use this utility to find and potentially exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities in web application. To use this tool, some knowledge of SQL Injection - even though a basic one - is essential. Most of what you will have to do, in typical cases, will be to enter the URL of the suceptible page, selecting the applicable method clicking 'Analyze'. Almost everything needed to reveal and make use of the vulnerabilities is done by the utility. For best results, the URL should be one that returns a normal response (rather than one that returns a 4xx response).
